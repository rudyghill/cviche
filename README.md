# cviche
You have many skills. Your resume/CV is limited in space and attention. Tag your skills and list them according to the job you are applying.

Pronounced like "ceviche".

## For users
This is a WIP. Basically notes right now.
```sh
python3 cviche.py -m skl -c example/skills.csv -t libre
```

For my usage of ``experience.py``:
```sh
python3 experience.py example/experience.csv software < example/experience_template.ms
```
### MacOS
```sh
python3 python3 cviche.py -m skl -c example/skills.csv -t libre | pbcopy
```
### Linux
``TODO``
### Windows
Not going to bother. If you know a good way in powershell DM me on X. I won't test it myself but I'll include it. Otherwise, I won't bother.

## For developers
We use ``black`` for code formatting.
