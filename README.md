# cviche
You have many skills. Your resume/CV is limited in space and attention. Tag your skills and list them according to the job you are applying.

Pronounced like "ceviche". Credit to [Philip Massouh](https://github.com/philipmassouh) for the name.

## For users
This is a WIP. Basically notes right now. (As I experiment this will not work).

within "files"
```sh
python3 ../../cviche.py -t hardware -y config.yaml && groff -ms -t -T pdf output/resume.ms > output/resume.pdf
```
### Linux
``TODO``
### Windows
Not going to bother. If you know a good way in powershell DM me on X. I won't test it myself but I'll include it. Otherwise, I won't bother.

## For developers
We use ``black`` for code formatting.
